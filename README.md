# pending-txt-api-scrape
scrape of pending txt's from explorer.enix.ai as an api.

Note: cron_ptrans.php is the CRON file which checks pending transactions one by one page and count. That script generates one TXT file (pending_transactions.txt) and in front-end you will need to display/print content using jQuery.
